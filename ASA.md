# Awesome Sustainability Actions

* Public hand washing
Don't use dryer or paper towels. You can air dry your hands or wipe them on your clothes. It's only water after all.

* Ice Cream choice
Ask for your ice cream in a waffle cone. It tastes nice (and will bio degrade whatever you do with it) and avoids plastic/paper cup and plastic spoons.
