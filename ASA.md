# Awesome Sustainability Actions

### Simple actions you can take right now to live more sustainably. Tread lightly.  

##### Public hand washing
*Don't use dryer or paper towels.*  
You can air dry your hands or wipe them on your clothes. It's only water after all.
  
##### Ice Cream choice
*Ask for your ice cream in a waffle instead of a waxed paper or plastic container.*  
It will bio degrade whatever you do with it and it avoids paper cup and plastic spoons.

##### Less soap
*Use few soaps and body products.*  
Water will clean you of almost anything. Most everything else is to make you smell nice. Pick one.

##### Bring bag
*Always have a carry bag with you*  
You'll never "have to" get a new plastic bag if you have one already.

###### Buy stylish
*Choose stylish clothes that never go out of fashion*  
Fashion is what industry wants, style is what people want.

###### Repurpose
*Some products can be useful beyond their original design.* 
Use shower caps to cover containers instead of plastic wrap (HT Neven Mrgan)
