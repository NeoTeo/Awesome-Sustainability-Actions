# Awesome Sustainability Actions

##### Public hand washing
*Don't use dryer or paper towels.*  
You can air dry your hands or wipe them on your clothes. It's only water after all.
  
##### Ice Cream choice
*Ask for your ice cream in a waffle cone.*  
It will bio degrade whatever you do with it and it avoids paper cup and plastic spoons.
